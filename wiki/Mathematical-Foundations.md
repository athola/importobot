# Mathematical Foundations

This document covers the mathematical principles behind Importobot's format detection and optimization algorithms. It is intended for engineers who want to understand the 'why' behind the code, not just the 'how'.

## Motivation

Importobot needs to reliably identify different test export formats (Zephyr, TestRail, etc.) from a variety of JSON structures. A simple string search or a series of `if/else` statements would be brittle and difficult to maintain. Instead, we use Bayesian confidence scoring to make an educated guess about the format, based on the evidence found in the file.

This approach allows us to:

- **Handle ambiguity:** When a file could be multiple formats, the Bayesian scorer provides a probability for each, allowing us to either pick the most likely one or flag it for manual review.
- **Learn from new data:** As we encounter new examples of export formats, we can update our model to improve its accuracy.
- **Provide better feedback:** Instead of a simple "format not recognized" error, we can tell the user *why* we think a file is a certain format, based on the evidence we found.

Similarly, the optimization algorithms described in this document are used to fine-tune the conversion process, ensuring that the generated Robot Framework code is as accurate and efficient as possible.

Importobot uses Bayesian confidence scoring to detect test management formats. The current implementation handles two-stage classification: first validating that input is test data, then discriminating between specific formats like Zephyr vs TestRail.

## Overview

**Currently Implemented (v0.1.x):**
- Bayesian confidence scoring for format detection
- Two-stage classification: test data validation → format discrimination
- Numerical stability handling

**Future Work:**
- Format family models to group related formats (Atlassian: Zephyr + JIRA)
- Semantic boosting for domain-specific formats like TestLink
- Threshold optimization using ROC curves from production data

## Core Mathematical Framework

The heart of Importobot's format detection is a Bayesian scorer. This section explains the key concepts behind it.

### Bayesian Confidence Scoring

Instead of writing a complex set of rules to identify each format, we use probabilities. The core idea is to calculate the probability of a file being a certain format, given the evidence we see in the file. This is expressed by Bayes' theorem:

`P(Format | Evidence) = [P(Evidence | Format) * P(Format)] / P(Evidence)`

- `P(Format | Evidence)` is the **posterior probability**: what we want to calculate. It's the probability that the file is a specific `Format` given the `Evidence` we've seen.
- `P(Evidence | Format)` is the **likelihood**: the probability of seeing this `Evidence` if the file *is* that `Format`.
- `P(Format)` is the **prior probability**: our initial belief about how common a `Format` is.
- `P(Evidence)` is a **normalization factor**.

In the codebase, you'll find this implemented in `src/importobot/medallion/bronze/confidence_calculator.py`. The `calculate_confidence()` method takes the evidence collected by the `EvidenceCollector` and uses it to compute the posterior probability for each supported format.

### Two-Stage Classification

To avoid running the full Bayesian analysis on every file, we use a two-stage process:

1.  **Test Data Validation Gate:** First, we do a quick check to see if the file looks like a test export at all. This is a simple check for the presence of common keywords and structures. If it doesn't pass this gate, we don't proceed to the next stage.
2.  **Format-Specific Discrimination:** If the file passes the first stage, we then run the full Bayesian analysis to determine the specific format (Zephyr, TestRail, etc.).

This approach, implemented in `src/importobot/medallion/bronze/format_detector.py`, significantly improves performance by avoiding unnecessary computation on irrelevant files.

## Empirical Validation & Benchmarks [IMPLEMENTED]

Every release runs the fixtures in `tests/fixtures/format_detection_fixtures.py`; the results are in `wiki/benchmarks/format_detection_benchmark.json`. A 14/14 accuracy was preserved after the 0.1.2 rewrite and the ambiguous ratio was clamped at 1.5:1, as enforced by `tests/unit/medallion/bronze/test_bayesian_ratio_constraints.py`. Average detection time nudged from 53.8 ms to 55.0 ms over 200 conversions on a single core, which was within the tolerance established during performance analysis.

#### Numerical Stability

There were possible issues with division by zero in Bayesian calculations. The solution involved - use a configurable epsilon instead of a hardcoded value:

```python
# Before: Hardcoded epsilon
if denominator < 1e-15:
    return 0.0

# After: Configurable epsilon
if denominator < self.bayesian_config.numerical_epsilon:
    return 0.0
```

1e-15 was chosen as the epsilon value - it's between machine epsilon (~2.22e-16 for double precision) and a practical safety threshold. The validation range is 1e-20 < value < 1e-10 to ensure numerical safety without excessive precision.

#### Thread Safety

The rate limiter uses a token bucket algorithm with proper locking:

```python
class _SecurityRateLimiter:
    def __init__(self, max_calls: int, interval: float) -> None:
        self._events: Dict[str, Deque[float]] = {}
        self._lock = threading.Lock()

    def try_acquire(self, bucket: str) -> tuple[bool, float]:
        with self._lock:
            event_queue = self._events.setdefault(bucket, deque())
            # Clean up old events to prevent memory leaks
            while event_queue and now - event_queue[0] > self._interval:
                event_queue.popleft()
```

The lock prevents race conditions, and the automatic cleanup prevents uncontrolled memory growth. The string cache uses `functools.lru_cache(maxsize=1000)` which is thread-safe for reads and bounded in memory.

#### Historical Bayesian Implementation
The previous Bayesian confidence scoring system (2025 Q2-Q3) used a simplified approach:

```python
P(Format|Evidence) = P(Evidence|Format) × P(Format) / P(Evidence)
```

This Bayesian posterior probability forms the basis of Importobot's confidence scoring system:

- **P(Format|Evidence)**: Our confidence score (posterior probability)
- **P(Evidence|Format)**: Evidence strength given format (likelihood)
- **P(Format)**: Format prevalence (prior probability)
- **P(Evidence)**: Normalization factor (marginal probability)

With a blend of structural, semantic, and statistical evidence, a simple Bayesian model averaging sequence is applied:
```
P(Format|Evidence) = Σ P(Format|Evidence,Model_i) × P(Model_i|Evidence)
```
The weights (40% structural, 35% semantic, 25% statistical) were derived from calibration runs and increased the "generic" format confidence by approximately 10%.

### Information theory & pattern analysis

#### Mutual Information

```
I(Format; Pattern) = H(Format) - H(Format|Pattern)
```

Measures how much information patterns provide about format detection.

#### Entropy calculations

```
H(X) = -Σ p(x) × log₂(p(x))
H_total = 0.4 × H_keys + 0.4 × H_types + 0.2 × H_volume
```

**Components**:
- **Key Entropy**: Structural diversity (`log₂(unique_keys)`)
- **Type Entropy**: Distribution of value types
- **Volume Entropy**: Data volume complexity (`log₂(total_values)`)

#### Dynamic pattern coverage

```
coverage_ratio = sigmoid(entropy - entropy_threshold)
W_adjusted = W_base × coverage_ratio
```

Uses sigmoid transformation for smooth, theoretically justified confidence adjustments.

## Optimization Algorithms

Beyond format detection, Importobot uses optimization algorithms to fine-tune the conversion process. The goal is to generate Robot Framework code that is not only syntactically correct, but also efficient and idiomatic. This is an experimental area of the codebase, and the algorithms described here are used to explore different approaches to this problem.

### Gradient Descent

Gradient descent is a common optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a function. In our case, we use it to tune the parameters of our conversion engine to minimize a "cost function" that represents the quality of the generated code. For example, we might penalize the use of deprecated keywords or reward the use of more efficient ones.

You can see the implementation of this in `src/importobot/services/optimization_service.py`.

### Genetic Algorithms

Genetic algorithms are inspired by the process of natural selection. They are particularly useful for exploring a large search space of possible solutions. We use a genetic algorithm to experiment with different combinations of conversion strategies and select the one that produces the best results.

### Simulated Annealing

Simulated annealing is another optimization technique that is good at escaping local minima. It is used in our experimental optimization service to explore the solution space more thoroughly than gradient descent alone.


## Statistical Methods & Validation

### Cross-Validation Framework

**K-Fold Cross-Validation**:
```python
for fold in range(k_folds):
    validation_data = data_list[start_idx:end_idx]
    train_data = data_list[:start_idx] + data_list[end_idx:]
    
    for strategy in strategies:
        results = validate_multiple(validation_data, [strategy], context)
        valid_ratio = calculate_valid_ratio(results)
```

**Properties**:
- **Unbiased Estimation**: Lower variance than hold-out validation
- **Efficiency**: Uses all data for both training and validation
- **Complexity**: O(k×m×n) where k=folds, m=strategies, n=data size

### Bootstrap Confidence Intervals

**Algorithm**:
```python
for i in range(n_bootstrap):
    sample = resample_with_replacement(data)
    statistic = calculate_statistic(sample)
    bootstrap_statistics.append(statistic)
    
confidence_interval = percentile(bootstrap_statistics, [2.5, 97.5])
```

**Properties**:
- **Consistency**: Converges to true parameter as n→∞
- **Coverage**: Approximately 95% for large samples
- **Complexity**: O(b×n) where b=bootstrap samples, n=data size

## Numerical Stability

### Kahan Summation Algorithm

**Problem**: Floating-point precision loss in weighted averages

**Solution**:
```python
def stable_weighted_average(values, weights):
    total_weight = 0.0
    weighted_sum = 0.0
    compensation = 0.0
    
    for val, weight in zip(values, weights):
        y = weight - compensation
        t = total_weight + y
        compensation = (t - total_weight) - y
        total_weight = t
        
        y = (val * weight) - compensation
        t = weighted_sum + y
        compensation = (t - weighted_sum) - y
        weighted_sum = t
    
    return weighted_sum / total_weight
```

**Benefits**:
- **Error Bound**: |error| ≤ 2ε × Σ|values| where ε is machine epsilon
- **Stability**: Compensates for lost low-order bits
- **Accuracy**: Significantly better than naive summation

### Division by Zero Protection

**Implementation**:
```python
if abs(total_weight) < 1e-10:
    raise ValueError("Total weight is too close to zero")
```

**Benefits**:
- **Numerical Safety**: Prevents division by very small numbers
- **Threshold**: Uses machine epsilon scaled threshold
- **Error Handling**: Provides meaningful error messages

### Floating Point Precision Management

**Location**: `debug_advanced_confidence.py:134-137`

**Fixed Implementation**:
```python
statistical_score = (
    (math.log2(total_keys) if total_keys > 1 else 0) +
    min(2.0, nesting_depth * 0.5) +
    min(1.0, value_diversity * 0.3)
)
```

**Benefits**:
- **Operator Precedence**: Correct parentheses ensure proper evaluation order
- **Conditional Evaluation**: Safe handling of edge cases
- **Bounded Outputs**: All terms are bounded to prevent overflow

## Mathematical Proofs & Theorems

### Convergence Proof for Gradient Descent

#### Theorem

For a convex function f: ℝⁿ → ℝ with Lipschitz continuous gradient ∇f, gradient descent with learning rate α ≤ 1/L (where L is Lipschitz constant) converges to the global minimum.

#### Proof Sketch

1. **Lipschitz Continuity**: ||∇f(x) - ∇f(y)|| ≤ L||x - y||
2. **Descent Lemma**: f(y) ≤ f(x) + ∇f(x)ᵀ(y-x) + (L/2)||y-x||²
3. **Update Rule**: x_{k+1} = x_k - α∇f(x_k)
4. **Convergence**: f(x_k) - f(x*) ≤ (||x₀ - x*||²)/(2αk)

#### Application in Importobot

The conversion-quality objective is approximated as convex when running the experimental optimization service (`src/importobot/services/optimization_service.py`). Step sizes are truncated using the Lipschitz estimates produced in the same module, but can revert to a conservative default when the bound is unknown. The formal convergence claim serves as guidance for future tuning rather than a guarantee. Production deployments allow more data to be gathered for the hand-tuned heuristic.

### Bootstrap Consistency Theorem

#### Theorem

The bootstrap distribution of a statistic θ̂* converges in probability to the true sampling distribution of θ̂ as the sample size n → ∞, under generic regularity conditions.

#### Proof Sketch

1. **Empirical Distribution**: F̂_n converges to true distribution F
2. **Functional Delta Method**: θ̂ = φ(F̂_n), θ̂* = φ(F̂_n*)
3. **Convergence**: ||F̂_n* - F|| → 0 in probability
4. **Consistency**: θ̂* converges to θ̂ in distribution

#### Application in Importobot

Bootstrap summaries remain optional because large suites amplify compute cost. For data analysis improvements, typically in offline analysis notebooks, the fixtures contain hundreds of cases so the asymptotics matter. Judge the improvements to data quality results against the performance cost. TODO: capture concrete coverage numbers from those notebooks before recommending the approach for day-to-day use.

### Genetic Algorithm Convergence

#### Theorem

A genetic algorithm with elitism and mutation rate p_m > 0 converges to the global optimum with probability 1 as the number of generations g → ∞.

#### Proof Sketch

1. **Markov Chain**: Population states form a Markov chain
2. **Irreducibility**: Positive mutation rate keeps all states reachable
3. **Positive Recurrence**: Elitism prevents loss of best solutions
4. **Convergence**: Stationary distribution concentrates on optimum

#### Application in Importobot
Our prototype genetic optimiser keeps an elite slice of the population and enforces a non-zero mutation rate, matching the textbook assumptions. Nevertheless, the gold layer still prefers gradient descent because we have not benchmarked the GA on real customer data. Consider the proof above a justification for keeping the implementation around while we decide whether it proves its value.

### Simulated Annealing Convergence

#### Theorem

Simulated annealing with logarithmic cooling schedule T_k = T₀/log(k+1) converges to the global optimum with probability 1 as k → ∞.

#### Proof Sketch

1. **Inhomogeneous Markov Chain**: Temperature-dependent transition probabilities
2. **Detailed Balance**: π(x)P(x→y) = π(y)P(y→x) for stationary distribution
3. **Cooling Schedule**: The logarithmic schedule is the case that carries the formal convergence guarantee
4. **Weak Convergence**: Converges to delta distribution at optimum

#### Application in Importobot

- **Temperature Schedule**: Exponential cooling for practical convergence
- **Acceptance Probability**: Balances exploration and exploitation
- **Global Optimization**: Escapes local minima in parameter space
