# Importobot Wiki

Documentation for Importobot, a tool that converts Zephyr, Xray, TestLink exports into Robot Framework suites. Started as a script to avoid manual copy/paste work, now used in team CI pipelines.

If you are new, start with Getting Started. The other pages cover the conversion workflow, medallion layers, and production chores such as security, deployment, and benchmarks.

## Why Importobot?

Our team was spending hours manually retyping Zephyr test cases into Robot Framework. One customer export had 700 test cases with 10-15 steps eachâ€”that's 10,000 steps to retype by hand. We tried a few scripts but they always produced Robot files that needed manual cleanup.

The main problem we faced: every test management system generates slightly different JSON. Zephyr exports have different field names than TestRail, which differ from JIRA/Xray. We needed something that could handle these variations without requiring custom scripts for each system.

Importobot converts entire test suites with one command while preserving the original descriptions and tags for audit trails. When it encounters steps that can't be converted reliably, it flags them instead of guessing. This prevents silent errors in the generated tests.

We built this using test-driven development on real customer exports. The goal was to create Robot files that run without any post-conversion editing.

## Quick Start

### Simple Usage
```python
import importobot

converter = importobot.JsonToRobotConverter()
result = converter.convert_directory("/zephyr/exports", "/robot/tests")
print(result)
```

### API Integration
```python
from importobot.api import validation, suggestions
from importobot.integrations.clients import get_api_client, SupportedFormat

# Fetch directly from Zephyr with automatic discovery
client = get_api_client(
    SupportedFormat.ZEPHYR,
    api_url="https://your-zephyr.example.com",
    tokens=["your-token"],
    user=None,
    project_name="PROJECT",
    project_id=None,
    max_concurrency=None,
)

# Process results as they stream in
for payload in client.fetch_all(progress_callback=lambda **kw: print(f"Fetched {kw.get('items', 0)} items")):
    validation.validate_json_dict(payload)
    # Process or convert the payload
```

### Integration hooks
```python
from importobot.api import validation, suggestions

validation.validate_json_dict(test_data)
engine = suggestions.GenericSuggestionEngine()
notes = engine.suggest_improvements(problematic_tests)
```

## Recent Changes (October 2025)

### ðŸš€ Version 0.1.3 Release

**Application Context Pattern**: Replaced global variables with thread-local context for better test isolation and concurrent instance support. New `importobot.caching` module with unified LRU cache implementation.

**Enhanced Template Learning**: Blueprint system now learns from your existing Robot files using `--robot-template` flag. Cross-template learning captures consistent patterns and applies them to new conversions.

**Schema Parser**: New `--input-schema` flag reads your team's documentation (SOPs, READMEs) to understand organization-specific field naming conventions. Improves parsing accuracy from ~85% to ~95% on custom exports.

**Unified API Integration**: Enhanced `--fetch-format` parameter supporting Zephyr, TestRail, JIRA/Xray, and TestLink with automatic discovery and adaptive authentication.

**Comprehensive Documentation**: Added Migration Guide for 0.1.2â†’0.1.3 (no breaking changes), consolidated Breaking Changes documentation, and created Blueprint Tutorial with step-by-step guides.

### Previous Improvements

**Public API Formalization**: Stabilized pandas-style API surface with controlled `__all__` exports. Core implementation remains private while `importobot.api` provides enterprise toolkit.

**Template System**: The blueprint system learns from your existing Robot files. If you have a consistent way of writing test cases, Importobot will apply that pattern to new conversions. This replaced the old hardcoded templates.

**Format Detection**: Replaced the weighted heuristic scoring with proper Bayesian confidence calculation. The new system caps ambiguous ratios at 1.5:1 and applies penalties when required fields are missing.

**Test Generation**: Parameter conversion skips comment lines, so placeholders like `${USERNAME}` stay visible in traceability comments. Test cases now track both original and normalized names to catch edge cases with control characters.

**Code Quality**: Removed pylint from the project (now using ruff/mypy only) and improved test isolation with automatic context cleanup.

## Public API

Use these modules in your code:

- `importobot.JsonToRobotConverter` - Main conversion class
- `importobot.api.*` - Validation, suggestions, and converters
