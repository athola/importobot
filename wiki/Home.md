# Importobot Wiki

Welcome to the Importobot wiki! Importobot is a tool that converts test cases from various test management frameworks (Zephyr, JIRA/Xray, TestLink, etc.) into Robot Framework format.

Importobot automates the migration process, which would otherwise require manual conversion of thousands of test cases. It eliminates the tedious and error-prone process of manually converting test cases when teams want to adopt Robot Framework for automated testing.

- **Enterprise-Ready API**: Pandas-inspired design for professional integration
- **Bulk Conversion**: Handle thousands of test cases with single commands
- **CI/CD Integration**: Validation utilities for automated pipelines
- **QA Suggestion Engine**: Intelligent handling of ambiguous test cases
- **Multiple Format Support**: Zephyr JSON with JIRA/Xray and TestLink roadmap
- **Production-Ready Output**: Immediately executable Robot Framework files
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints and IDE support for development

## Why Importobot?

Organizations often have thousands of test cases in legacy test management tools. When teams want to adopt Robot Framework for automated testing, they face a choice:
- **Manual Migration**: Weeks or months of copy-paste work, prone to errors and inconsistencies.
- **Starting Over**: Losing years of accumulated test knowledge and business logic.
- **Status Quo**: Staying with suboptimal tooling due to migration complexity.

Importobot automates the conversion process:
- Convert test suites with a single command.
- Maintain test structure and metadata during conversion.
- Generate Robot Framework files that run without modification.
- Built using TDD practices for reliability.
- **Enterprise Test Generation**: Generate up to 1,050 test cases for comprehensive coverage.
- **Advanced Automation**: Support for SSH, API, database, and web automation with keyword libraries.
- **Intelligent Suggestions**: Automatic test improvement suggestions and validation framework.

## Quick Start

### Simple Usage
```python
import importobot

# Core bulk conversion
converter = importobot.JsonToRobotConverter()
result = converter.convert_directory("/zephyr/exports", "/robot/tests")
```

### Enterprise Integration
```python
from importobot.api import validation, converters, suggestions

# CI/CD pipeline validation
validation.validate_json_dict(test_data)

# QA suggestion engine
engine = suggestions.GenericSuggestionEngine()
fixes = engine.suggest_improvements(problematic_tests)
```

### API Design Philosophy

Importobot follows **pandas-inspired patterns** for enterprise readiness:
- **Clean Public Interface**: `import importobot` for core functionality
- **Enterprise Toolkit**: `importobot.api.*` for advanced features
- **Version Stability**: Public API contracts remain stable
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints and IDE support
