# Importobot Project Plan

This document outlines the roadmap for test framework conversion automation.

## Roadmap

### Near-term (Q3 2025)
- **Bulk Conversion**: Enhance bulk conversion capabilities.
- **Additional Formats**: Add support for JIRA/Xray and TestLink.
- **Intent Detection**: Enhance test step pattern recognition.
- **Library Coverage**: Expand Robot Framework library mappings.
- **Performance**: Optimize conversion speed for large test suites.
- **Timing Metrics**: Add timing metrics for conversion operations.
- **Configuration Optimization**: Externalize large configuration data structures.
- **I/O Optimization**: Optimize batch file I/O operations.

### Medium-term (Q4 2025-Q1 2026)
- **API Interface**: Create a REST API for CI/CD integration.
- **Plugin System**: Develop an extensible format converter architecture.
- **Quality Metrics**: Add conversion analytics and reporting.
- **Enterprise Features**: Implement advanced validation and error recovery.

### Long-term
- **Multi-framework Support**: Support conversion to frameworks other than Robot Framework.
- **AI-enhanced Conversion**: Add smart suggestions and predictive analysis.
- **Cloud Integration**: Create a cloud-based version of Importobot.

## Recent Improvements

### Artifact Management
- Enhanced `.gitignore` to properly exclude generated artifacts and test output files
- Added comprehensive `clean` and `deep-clean` Makefile targets to remove temporary files
- Removed accidentally committed artifacts and ensured repository cleanliness

### Code Quality Improvements
- Fixed linting issues throughout the codebase
- Removed unused imports and variables
- Standardized code formatting with automated tools
- Improved error handling and validation

### Test Coverage Enhancements
- Fixed failing tests related to missing test data files
- Improved test data management and file organization
- Enhanced test suite reliability and consistency

### Makefile Improvements
- Added missing targets to help menu for better discoverability
- All Makefile targets now documented in the help section
- Enhanced clean targets to remove additional artifact files

## Missing Test Coverage

### Error Scenarios
- **Large file handling**: Tests for processing extremely large test files
- **Network timeouts**: Tests for handling network interruptions during remote file operations
- **Malformed templates**: Tests for handling corrupted or incorrectly formatted template files

### Security Tests
- **Path traversal attempts**: Tests to prevent directory traversal attacks in file operations
- **Malicious JSON**: Tests for handling intentionally malformed or dangerous JSON inputs
- **Command injection**: Tests to prevent shell command injection through test parameters

### Performance Tests
- **Load testing for large-scale generation**: Tests to verify performance when generating thousands of test cases
- **Memory usage monitoring**: Tests to track memory consumption during large conversions
- **Concurrent processing**: Tests for handling multiple simultaneous conversion requests
