- **Silver**: Semantic validation, business rule compliance, data consistency
- **Gold**: Execution feasibility, performance optimization, export readiness

### Current Architecture Analysis

#### Current Data Flow:
1. **Input**: JSON test data files (various formats)
2. **Loading & Validation**: File I/O, JSON parsing, basic structure validation
3. **Parsing**: GenericTestFileParser finds test cases and steps
4. **Conversion**: GenericConversionEngine orchestrates transformation
5. **Library Detection**: Pattern matching for Robot Framework libraries
6. **Output Generation**: Assembles Robot Framework files
7. **Persistence**: Writes to .robot files

#### Medallion Enhancement Mapping:

4. **Enterprise Configuration**: Configurable limits and settings for production deployments

**Pattern Analysis & Validation:**
- Researched pandas, numpy, requests, flask import patterns
