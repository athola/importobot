# Importobot Project Roadmap

This document outlines the planned roadmap for the Importobot project, focusing on achieving **complete test framework conversion automation** across multiple input formats.

## 1. Vision

  - Test workflow with fail-fast: false strategy for complete visibility
  - Optimized caching with Python version isolation for faster builds
  - JUnit XML test reports uploaded as artifacts for detailed analysis
  - Conditional secret validation for secure CI/CD operations
- **Multi-Tool Linting**: Perfect code quality with ruff, pycodestyle, pydocstyle, pylint achieving 10.00/10 score and zero violations
- **AI-Powered Code Review**: Claude Code Review integration with automated feedback and suggestions
- **Dependency Management**: Automated weekly updates via Dependabot for GitHub Actions and Python packages
- **Workflow Validation**: Comprehensive testing of all GitHub Actions workflows ensuring YAML syntax and best practices
- **Coverage Reporting**: Codecov integration with conditional token validation for coverage tracking
- **Fast Package Management**: uv for 10-100x faster dependency resolution with deterministic builds
- **Organized Test Assets**: Enhanced `examples/json/` directory and comprehensive test infrastructure
- **Security Validation**: Automated security scanning with path traversal prevention, input validation, and sanitization

## 3. Roadmap Phases

### Phase 1: Format Expansion & Automation Enhancement (Q4 2024 - Q1 2025)

*   **Objective**: Achieve full automation for two additional major test management platforms while maintaining zero-manual-intervention standard.
*   **Automation Targets**:
    *   **JIRA/Xray JSON**: Complete automated conversion from JIRA/Xray JSON exports with identical quality to Zephyr conversion
    *   **TestLink XML**: Full automation support for TestLink XML exports, handling all metadata and test structure
    *   **Format Auto-Detection**: Eliminate manual format specification - tool automatically detects input format
    *   **Batch Processing**: Enhanced batch conversion capabilities for mixed-format input directories
*   **Quality Assurance (TDD/XP Approach)**:
    *   Write comprehensive test suites for each new format before implementation begins
    *   Create mock data sets representing real-world test exports for thorough validation
    *   Establish conversion accuracy benchmarks (100% field preservation, 100% executability)
    *   Implement regression testing to ensure new formats don't break existing conversions

### Phase 2: Intelligent Automation & Advanced Processing (Q2 2025 - Q3 2025)

*   **Objective**: Enhance automation intelligence with advanced processing capabilities while maintaining zero-manual-intervention philosophy.
*   **Advanced Automation Features**:
    *   **Smart Field Mapping**: AI-powered field mapping that learns from conversion patterns to handle custom fields automatically
    *   **Intelligent Filtering**: Automated test case filtering based on execution probability, redundancy detection, and business value scoring
    *   **Quality Analytics**: Automated conversion quality reporting with immediate feedback on potential issues
    *   **Configuration-Free Operation**: Self-tuning conversion parameters based on input data analysis
*   **TDD Implementation Strategy**:
    *   Develop machine learning models using test-first approach with extensive training data validation
    *   Create automated benchmarking suites to measure conversion quality improvements
    *   Implement A/B testing framework for conversion algorithm optimization
    *   Build comprehensive integration tests for advanced feature combinations

### Phase 3: Ecosystem Integration & Platform Scaling (Q4 2025 onwards)

*   **Objective**: Scale automation solution across enterprise environments and enable community-driven format expansion.
*   **Platform Scaling Features**:
    *   **Enterprise API**: Production-ready REST API for integration into enterprise CI/CD pipelines
    *   **Cloud-Native Deployment**: Container-ready deployment with auto-scaling conversion processing
    *   **Integration Plugins**: Direct plugins for major test management platforms (Atlassian, Microsoft, etc.)
    *   **Community Format Engine**: Framework enabling community contributions of new format converters with automated validation
*   **Ecosystem Quality Assurance**:
    *   Automated validation pipeline for community-contributed format converters
    *   Comprehensive API contract testing for enterprise integrations
    *   Performance benchmarking across enterprise-scale test suites
    *   Security auditing for all integration points

## 4. TDD/XP Methodology Commitment

Throughout all phases, Importobot maintains unwavering commitment to Test-Driven Development and Extreme Programming practices:

### Development Standards
- **Test-First**: All features implemented only after comprehensive test suites are written and failing
- **Continuous Integration**: Every code change validated through automated testing pipeline
- **Refactoring Discipline**: Regular code improvement while maintaining 100% test coverage
- **Simple Design**: Avoid over-engineering - implement simplest solution that passes all tests

### Quality Guarantees
- **Conversion Accuracy**: TDD ensures every format conversion is validated before implementation
- **Regression Prevention**: Comprehensive test suites prevent new features from breaking existing functionality
- **Performance Reliability**: Load testing validates batch processing capabilities at enterprise scale
- **Security Assurance**: Security testing integrated into TDD cycle for all input parsing operations with path traversal prevention, input validation, and sanitization
- **Automated Quality Gates**: GitHub Actions enforce code quality standards on every pull request
- **Multi-Python Compatibility**: Automated testing ensures compatibility across Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12

## 5. Non-Goals

*   Bidirectional conversion (Robot Framework to other formats) - maintain focus on inbound automation
*   Manual conversion modes or interactive wizards - commitment to 100% automation
*   Full test management system features - focused purely on format conversion excellence
*   Support for all possible formats simultaneously - prioritize popular and high-impact formats

## 6. Success Metrics & Feedback

### Automation Success Metrics
- **Conversion Completeness**: 100% of input fields successfully mapped to Robot Framework equivalents
- **Execution Readiness**: 100% of generated Robot Framework tests execute without modification
- **Processing Speed**: Handle 1000+ test case conversions in under 5 minutes
- **Format Coverage**: Support for 80% of enterprise test management platforms by end of Phase 3

This roadmap evolves based on real-world usage patterns, community feedback, and enterprise adoption requirements. We welcome contributions that advance our core automation mission.
