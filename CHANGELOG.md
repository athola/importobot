## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Security regression tests covering API token masking, TLS flag handling, request verb injection, and rate limiter bypass attempts (`tests/unit/test_api_security.py`).
- Hash/checksum steps now auto-generate Robot-friendly comparison commands instead of leaving placeholders, including multi-command expansion via the multi-command parser.
- Added `examples/json/hash_compare.json` to demonstrate automatic comparison step generation via `--apply-suggestions`.
- `EvidenceMetrics` dataclass plus additional regression coverage (`tests/unit/medallion/bronze/test_bayesian_ratio_constraints.py`, `tests/unit/medallion/bronze/test_independent_bayesian_scorer.py`) that holds the independent Bayesian scorer to the 1.5:1 ambiguity cap and validates posterior normalization.
- Benchmark artifacts under `wiki/benchmarks/` covering format-detection accuracy, detection latency, and regex cache performance.
- Environment flags (`IMPORTOBOT_SECURITY_RATE_MAX_QUEUE`, `IMPORTOBOT_SECURITY_RATE_BACKOFF_BASE`, `IMPORTOBOT_SECURITY_RATE_BACKOFF_MAX`) to tune the security gateway rate limiter.
- `wiki/architecture/Blueprint-Learning.md` documenting the blueprint learning pipeline and debugging tips.
- Configuration terminology guide in the README describing the shift from "fallback" helpers to "default" helpers.
- Pyright static analysis in CI for cross-checking mypy/ty results.
- **API Retrieval Integration** with support for Zephyr, TestRail, JIRA/Xray, and TestLink platforms:
  - **Enhanced Zephyr Client** with automatic API discovery and adaptive authentication strategies
  - **Multi-Platform Support** for Jira/Xray, Zephyr for Jira, TestRail, and TestLink APIs
  - **Flexible Authentication** supporting Bearer tokens, API keys, Basic auth, and dual-token setups
  - **Adaptive Pagination** with auto-detection of optimal page sizes based on server limits
  - **Robust Payload Handling** supporting diverse endpoint response structures
  - **Progress Feedback** with detailed reporting during large fetch operations
  - **Environment Variable Configuration** with format-specific credential management
  - **Container and Kubernetes Deployment** examples for production environments
  - **Security Best Practices** documentation for API token management and monitoring

### Changed
- CI enforces a minimum pytest collection count via `scripts/devtools/check_test_count.py` to keep reported coverage numbers honest.
- Blueprint registry now caches sanitised templates to disk and logs ingestion progress so large template sets no longer stall startup.
- LRU cache evicts in measured batches, warns on pathological inserts, and avoids unbounded eviction loops.
- Project ID validation now enforces signed 64-bit limits (raising `ConfigurationError` when exceeded) and documents the constraint.
- `update_medallion_config` now imports its Medallion dependency lazily to avoid circular imports and surfaces a clear error when the optional component is absent.
- CLI conversions no longer use blueprints unless `--robot-template` is supplied (or explicitly forced), keeping default renders free of remote/CLI assumptions.
- Blueprint registry now caches sanitised templates to disk and logs ingestion progress so large template sets no longer stall startup.
- Replaced the weighted evidence scorer with the independent Bayesian pipeline. Evidence penalties are now explicit constants and ambiguous data is capped at a 1.5:1 likelihood ratio.
- Hardened the rate limiter with queue caps and exponential backoff; cleaned up the README and wiki to describe the migration path.
- Updated documentation to explain the removal of the `robot.utils` shim and to show empirical results from the new scorer.
- **Enhanced CLI Interface** with `--fetch-format` parameter and shared credential flags for API integration
- **Improved Documentation** across README.md, User Guide, and Deployment Guide with API integration examples
- **Extended Public API** with programmatic access to platform clients via `importobot.integrations.clients`
- Split `blueprints.py` into modular components (`registry.py`, `models.py`, `utils.py`, `cli_builder.py`, `render.py`) with hardened ingestion error reporting.
- Renamed helper APIs from "fallback" to "default/secondary" to keep terminology consistent with configuration defaults.

### Removed
- Legacy `WeightedEvidenceBayesianScorer` entry points and the analysis scripts that referred to it.

## [0.1.2] - 2025-10-21

### Added
- **Application Context Pattern**: Replaced global variables with thread-local application context for better test isolation and dependency management
- **Unified Caching System**: New `importobot.caching` module with LRU cache implementation and security policies

- **Architecture Documentation**: Added ADR-0004 for Application Context Pattern

### Fixed
- **Configuration Resilience**: Enhanced `_parse_project_identifier()` to handle control characters and whitespace-only inputs
- **Project Resolution Defaults**: Improved default-selection logic so CLI arguments that don't parse to valid identifiers use environment variables instead
- **Blueprint Learning Tests**: Fixed test issues with blueprint template system
- **Test Coverage**: Achieved 1,946 tests passing with 0 skips after rewriting Zephyr client discovery test

### Changed
- **Removed Pylint**: Dropped pylint from project, now using ruff/mypy only for streamlined linting
- **Documentation**: Rewrote 5 wiki files to remove formulaic openings and marketing language; replaced with specific technical details and measured outcomes
- **Bayesian Scoring**: Replaced weighted evidence heuristic with proper Bayesian inference; ambiguous inputs capped at 1.5:1 ratio based on ROC analysis of 200 test files
- **Dependencies**: Removed `robot.utils` compatibility shim after Robot Framework updates
- **Configuration Terminology**: Changed from "fallback" to "default/secondary" helpers for consistency

### Technical Details
- Added `raw.isspace()` check in configuration parsing for better whitespace handling
- Implemented thread-local context storage for concurrent instance support
- Created three-tier caching system with LRU cache for patterns, disk cache for templates, and session cache for API calls
- Enhanced blueprint learning with cross-template pattern recognition
