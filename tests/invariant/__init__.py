"""Invariant tests using Hypothesis for system-wide property-based testing.

This module implements comprehensive property-based testing to explore edge cases
and validate system-wide invariants that should hold true regardless of input.

The tests use Hypothesis to generate diverse inputs and attempt to break
the properties that the code should uphold.
