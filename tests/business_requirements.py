"""Business requirements constants for Importobot test suite.

This module centralizes all business-justified thresholds and requirements
to eliminate magic numbers and improve test maintainability.

All constants are documented with:
- Business justification
- Requirement reference (where available)
- Stakeholder approval date
- Mathematical/technical rationale
